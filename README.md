# Project 15 - React Redux Todo App üìù
This is a Todo App built with Redux toolkit. It's pretty simple: You can add tasks, see a list of the added tasks, toggle whether a task is done or not and remove tasks. You can also see when your task was added thanks to moment.js. If I were to put more time into this I would've read in on how to persist the State to the Local Storage.

Here you can see it in action: https://matilda-arvidsson-project-todo-app.netlify.com/
